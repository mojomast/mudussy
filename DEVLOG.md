- **Session States**: `AUTHENTICATING` ‚Üí `CONNECTING` ‚Üí `CONNECTED` ‚Üí `DISCONNECTING` ‚Üí `DISCONNECTED`
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request limits with sliding window implementation
- **Idle Timeouts**: Automatic session cleanup with configurable timeout periods
- **Telnet Protocol Support**: Full Telnet option negotiation and command handling

**Key Features**:
- **Security**: Rate limiting prevents abuse, idle timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
- **Scalability**: In-memory session storage with efficient cleanup routines
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive statistics and event logging
- **State Tracking**: Complete session lifecycle with metadata collection

**Design Decisions**:
- **UUID Sessions**: Cryptographically secure session IDs prevent enumeration attacks
- **Event-Driven**: All session events flow through the event system for loose coupling
- **Configurable Limits**: Connection limits, timeouts, and rate limits are externally configurable
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of idle sessions and rate limiting data

### Communication Architecture

**Dual-Protocol Support**:
- **Telnet Server**: Traditional MUD protocol with ANSI color support and line-based communication
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Modern web client support using Socket.IO with real-time bidirectional communication
- **Unified Interface**: Both protocols route through the same command system and event architecture

**Message Routing**:
- **Event System Integration**: All communication flows through the centralized event system
- **Broadcasting**: Efficient message distribution to multiple sessions with exclusion support
- **Message Types**: Categorized messaging (system, user, error, info, broadcast) with appropriate formatting
- **Session Isolation**: Messages can be targeted to specific sessions or broadcast to all

**Technical Implementation**:
- **TelnetServer Class**: Node.js net.Server with custom protocol handling
- **WebSocketGateway**: NestJS WebSocket gateway with Socket.IO integration
- **ANSI Color Support**: Full VT100/ANSI color code support for rich terminal displays

**Built-in Commands**:
- **Core Commands**: `help`, `quit`, `clear`, `version`
- **Communication**: `say`, `whisper`, `chat` (global messaging)
- **Information**: `who`, `stats`, `look`
- **Movement**: Full directional movement system (`north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, etc.)
- **Social**: Player listing and status commands

**Design Principles**:
- **Modular Registration**: Commands can be registered/unregistered at runtime
- **Permission System**: Framework for authentication and admin-only commands (extensible)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Help System**: Automatic help generation and context-sensitive assistance

### Player Persistence System

**Design Decisions**:
- **Data Integrity First**: Checksums and validation prevent data corruption
- **Backup Safety**: All saves create backups before modification
- **Structured Saves**: Well-defined save format for future extensibility
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient file operations with caching where appropriate

### Technical Implementation Details

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
- **Centralized Events**: All system communication flows through the event system

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Efficient Broadcasting**: Optimized message distribution algorithms
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of idle sessions and expired data
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections
- **Event Throttling**: Rate limiting at multiple levels to prevent system overload

### Integration Points

**World System Integration**:
- **Room Management**: Players are tracked in world rooms with proper cleanup
- **NPC Interaction**: Command system integrates with NPC dialogue and behavior
- **Movement System**: Seamless integration between commands and world navigation
- **Event Propagation**: World events are broadcast to relevant player sessions
