## Introduction

### Content Architecture Overview

The MUD engine uses a modular content system with the following structure:

```
content/
├── npcs/           # Individual NPC definitions (JSON)
├── dialogue/       # Dialogue trees (YAML)
├── sectors/        # World areas (JSON)
└── world.json      # World configuration
```

### Key Concepts

- **NPCs**: Dynamic characters with behaviors, stats, and dialogue
- **Dialogue**: Branching conversation trees with conditions and actions
- **Sectors**: Geographic areas containing rooms, items, and NPCs
- **Items**: Objects that can be interacted with or collected
- **Conditions**: Requirements that must be met for choices or actions
- **Actions**: Effects that occur during dialogue interactions

### File Format Standards

- **NPCs**: JSON with consistent structure and metadata
- **Dialogue**: YAML for human-readable branching conversations
- **Sectors**: JSON with nested room and item definitions
- **All files**: Include version, author, and creation metadata

---

## World Structure

### Starting Room ID

- The server prefers the environment variable `MUD_DEFAULT_ROOM_ID` for spawning new players.
- This must match an actual room `id` present after the world is fully merged (base `world.json` plus any `sectors/*.json`).
- If the configured ID is missing, the engine automatically falls back to the first loaded room.

### World Loading Order

1. Load base `world.json` from `MUD_WORLD_PATH` (see README Environment Configuration).
2. If `world.json` lists `sectors`, each sector JSON is loaded and its `areas`, `rooms`, `items`, and `npcs` are appended to the world.
3. The engine normalizes arrays and builds fast lookup maps (rooms/items/npcs/areas) after merge.

Tips:
- Ensure arrays like `rooms`, `items`, and `npcs` exist (can be empty) in your JSON files.
- Prefer globally unique room IDs (e.g., `eldoria:tavern`) to avoid collisions across sectors.

### Sector Design

Sectors are large geographic areas containing multiple rooms:

```json
{
  "id": "town-sector",
  "name": "Town of Eldoria",
  "description": "A bustling medieval town with shops, tavern, and residential areas",
  "rooms": [...],
  "items": [...],
  "npcs": [...]
}
```

### Room Creation

#### Basic Room Template

```json

```

### Navigation Design

#### Good Navigation Patterns

```json
{
  "id": "hub_room",
  "name": "Town Square",
  "description": "Central hub with multiple exits",
  "exits": [
    {
      "id": "to_tavern",
      "direction": "north",
      "toRoomId": "tavern",
      "description": "The Prancing Pony Tavern",
      "verbs": ["north", "tavern"]
    },
    {
      "id": "to_blacksmith",
      "direction": "east",
      "toRoomId": "blacksmith",
      "description": "The blacksmith shop",
      "verbs": ["east", "blacksmith"]
    },
    {
      "id": "to_gate",
      "direction": "south",
      "toRoomId": "town_gate",
      "description": "The town gate",
      "verbs": ["south", "gate"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Avoid Navigation Problems

```json
{
  "exits": [
    // Good: Multiple verbs for flexibility
    {
      "id": "to_forest",
      "direction": "north",
      "toRoomId": "forest_entrance",
      "description": "A path leading into the forest",
      "verbs": ["north", "path", "forest", "n"]
    },
    // Bad: Only one verb, hard to discover
    {
      "id": "hidden_path",
      "direction": "northeast",
      "toRoomId": "secret_clearing",
      "description": "A barely visible trail",
      "verbs": ["northeast"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### World Validation Checklist

- [ ] All room IDs are unique within sector
- [ ] All exit toRoomId references exist
- [ ] No isolated rooms (all rooms reachable)
- [ ] Consistent navigation (no conflicting exits)
- [ ] Appropriate room descriptions and names
- [ ] Items have valid types and flags
- [ ] NPC room references exist
- [ ] No circular dependencies in conditions
- [ ] Performance considerations (not too many items/NPCs per room)
- [ ] Logical geographic layout

## Content Integration

### NPC-to-Dialogue Mapping

```json
{
  "blacksmith": "blacksmith",
  "gate_guard": "guard",
  "innkeeper": "merchant",
  "mysterious_stranger": "quest_giver"
}
```

### Cross-References

#### Item References in Dialogue

```yaml
actions:
  - type: give_item
    target: steel_sword
    quantity: 1

conditions:
  - type: item
    operator: has
    target: quest_token
```

#### NPC References in Sectors

```json
{
  "npcs": [
    {
      "id": "blacksmith",
      "name": "the blacksmith",
      "roomId": "blacksmith_shop",
      "dialogueProvider": "canned-branching"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content Dependencies

#### Quest Chain Example

```yaml
# Quest 1: Gather Ingredients
id: gather_ingredients
startNodeId: quest_start
variables:
  quest_stage: 0

nodes:
  quest_start:
    npcMessage: "Bring me 3 wolf pelts and I'll craft you armor."
    actions:
      - type: start_quest
        target: gather_ingredients_quest

# Quest 2: Deliver Armor (depends on Quest 1 completion)
nodes:
  armor_delivery:
    npcMessage: "Here's your armor, crafted from those wolf pelts!"
    condition:
      type: quest
      operator: equals
      target: gather_ingredients_quest
      value: completed
    actions:
      - type: give_item
        target: wolf_armor
```

    │   ├── swords/
    │   └── axes/
    └── consumables/
        ├── potions/
        └── food/
```

### Naming Conventions

#### File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `blacksmith-dialogue.yaml`
- Group related content: `town-merchants/`
- Use descriptive names: `gate-guard-patrol.json`

#### ID Naming

- Use underscores: `steel_sword`, `town_guard`
- Be specific: `eldoria_town_gate` not `gate`
- Include context: `forest_wolf_pack` not `wolf`

#### Variable Naming

- Use snake_case: `friendship_level`, `quest_completed`
- Be descriptive: `has_met_blacksmith` not `met_b`
- Group related variables: `quest_forest_stage1`, `quest_forest_stage2`

### Testing and Validation

#### Dialogue Testing Checklist

- [ ] All dialogue branches explored
- [ ] Edge cases handled (insufficient gold, missing items)
- [ ] Variable changes work correctly
- [ ] Quest integration functions properly
- [ ] No dead-end conversations
- [ ] Fallback options for failed conditions

#### NPC Testing Checklist

- [ ] Spawn/despawn conditions work
- [ ] Dialogue integration functions
- [ ] Stats appropriate for level
- [ ] Behaviors consistent with character
- [ ] No conflicts with other NPCs

#### World Testing Checklist

- [ ] All rooms accessible
- [ ] Navigation intuitive
- [ ] Items function correctly
- [ ] NPC placements logical
- [ ] No performance issues

### Performance Considerations

#### NPC Optimization

```json
{
  "spawnData": {
    "spawnConditions": [
      {
        "type": "player_distance",
        "value": 5
      }
    ],
    "despawnConditions": [
      {
        "type": "no_players_nearby",
        "delay": 30000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Dialogue Optimization

```yaml
# Use variables instead of complex conditions
nodes:
  efficient_check:
    npcMessage: "{{friend_level > 5 ? 'Good to see you again, friend!' : 'Hello, stranger.'}}"
```

#### World Optimization

- Limit items per room (max 5-10)
- Use conditional spawns for NPCs
- Group related rooms in sectors
- Avoid complex exit conditions

## Multi-User Features

### Communication Patterns

#### Player-to-Player Communication

Multi-user environments thrive on player interaction. Design communication systems that encourage cooperation and social gameplay:

```yaml
# Tavern conversation hub
id: tavern_social
name: "Tavern Social Hub"
description: "Central gathering place for player interaction"
version: "1.0.0"
startNodeId: enter_tavern

variables:
  player_count: 0
  active_conversations: []

nodes:
  enter_tavern:
    id: enter_tavern
    npcMessage: |
      You enter The Prancing Pony tavern. {{player_count > 0 ?
      `You see ${player_count} other adventurers here, engaged in conversation.` :
      'The tavern is quiet, with only a few patrons at the bar.'}}

      The barkeep nods at you from behind the counter.
    choices:
      - id: "1"
        text: "Join the conversation with other players"
        nextNodeId: social_interaction
        condition:
          type: player_count
          operator: greater_than
          value: 0
      - id: "2"
        text: "Approach the barkeep"
        nextNodeId: barkeep_interaction
      - id: "3"
        text: "Find a quiet corner to rest"
        nextNodeId: rest_area

  social_interaction:
    id: social_interaction
    npcMessage: |
      You join a group of adventurers sharing stories of their quests.
      They're discussing a recent goblin raid on the trade routes.
    choices:
      - id: "1"
        text: "Share your own adventure stories"
        nextNodeId: share_story
      - id: "2"
        text: "Ask about the goblin raid"
        nextNodeId: discuss_raid
      - id: "3"
        text: "Propose forming a party for a quest"
        nextNodeId: form_party
```

```yaml
# Town crier announcements
id: town_crier
